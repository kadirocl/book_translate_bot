Title: The Power of Habit

Chapter 1: The Habit Loop
Habits emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort. This process within our brains is a three-step loop: cue, routine, and reward.

Chapter 2: The Craving Brain
Cravings are what drive habits. To create a new habit, you must find a simple and obvious cue and clearly define the rewards.

Chapter 3: The Golden Rule of Habit Change
You can’t extinguish a bad habit, you can only change it. Use the same cue and provide the same reward, but shift the routine.

Quotes:
- "Change might not be fast and it isn’t always easy. But with time and effort, almost any habit can be reshaped."
- "The Golden Rule of Habit Change: You can’t extinguish a bad habit, you can only change it."

Summary:
This book explores the science behind why habits exist and how they can be changed. It explains the habit loop and emphasizes the power of cravings in forming routines. Ultimately, it offers a framework for transforming habits by maintaining cues and rewards while changing behaviors.
